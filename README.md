Payment Processing System 

In my latest Java project, I developed a Payment Processing System that simulates the payment process through various methods: Cash, Credit Card, and Debit Card.

Key Features:

1)Cash Payment: Users can make payments using cash by simply entering the amount.

2)Credit Card Payment: This allows users to enter their credit card details (name, 16-digit number) and the payment amount. The program also masks the card number for security purposes.

3)Debit Card Payment: Similar to the credit card option, users can enter their 16-digit debit card number and the payment amount.

Core Functionalities:

1)Amount Validation: Ensures that the entered amount is greater than zero.

2)Card Number Validation: Validates that the card numbers (both credit and debit) are exactly 16 digits long.

3)Card Masking: For security, the credit/debit card number is partially masked (showing only the last four digits).

Implementation:

Utilized Java for the main functionality and implemented switch-case statements for handling different payment methods.

Used the Scanner class for user input and applied basic validations to ensure accurate data entry.

Testing:

I successfully passed various test cases, including edge cases like invalid card numbers and amounts, ensuring a robust user experience.

This project allowed me to enhance my Java programming skills while focusing on real-world applications like payment processing systems.
